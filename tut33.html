</div>
Explanation:
HTML Structure: We have a <div class="ring"> that contains four child <div> elements, each representing a colored segment (red, blue, green, and yellow).

CSS Styles:

The .ring is a circular container with a width and height of 200px and a border-radius of 50% to make it round.
The .segment classes are positioned absolutely within the ring to take up 50% of the space, each rotated by 90 degrees (red at 0°, blue at 90°, etc.).
The hover effect is achieved by adding a CSS @keyframes animation to rotate the entire .ring element when hovered. It smoothly rotates from 0 to 360 degrees in a circular motion.
When you hover over the ring, it will rotate continuously in a smooth circular motion.
